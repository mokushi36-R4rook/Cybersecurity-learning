# DNS Incident Report

## Overview
This report analyzes a connectivity issue encountered during a lab exercise.  
Several users were unable to access the website **www.yummyrecipesforme.com** and received the error message:  
`destination port unreachable`.  

The goal of this report is to summarize the network traffic logs and provide possible causes for the incident.

## Part 1 — Summary of the problem
Packet capture shows that DNS lookups to the resolver at **203.0.113.2** were sent via UDP but elicited ICMP responses indicating **"udp port 53 unreachable"**.  

As a result, DNS queries for `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` failed, preventing the browser from retrieving the IP address and establishing an HTTPS connection to the server.

## Part 2 — Analysis and probable cause
The ICMP error message indicates that UDP packets reached a device that reported no service listening on UDP port 53.  
The most likely cause is that the **DNS service was not running or not bound to UDP/53** (for example, the DNS daemon was stopped or misconfigured).  

An alternative possibility is that a **firewall or network device** actively rejected DNS requests to port 53 and sent ICMP Port Unreachable responses.  

To confirm the root cause, server-side checks would be required:
- Verify DNS service status and configuration  
- Check listening ports (UDP/53)  
- Review firewall or access control rules  
- Run packet captures on the DNS server itself

## Lessons Learned
- ICMP “port unreachable” messages can originate from either a host with no service listening, or from a firewall actively rejecting packets.  
- Analyzing both DNS and ICMP traffic together provides valuable insight into why higher-level protocols (such as HTTPS) fail.  
- In incident reports, it is important to present both the **observed facts** (log evidence) and **possible causes** without over-speculation.
