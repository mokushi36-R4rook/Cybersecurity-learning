# DNS Incident Report

## Overview
This report analyzes a connectivity issue encountered during a lab exercise.  
Several users were unable to access the website **www.yummyrecipesforme.com** and received the error message:  
`destination port unreachable`.  

The goal of this report is to summarize the network traffic logs and provide possible causes for the incident.

## Part 1 — Summary of the problem
Packet capture shows that DNS lookups to the resolver at **203.0.113.2** were sent via UDP but elicited ICMP responses indicating **"udp port 53 unreachable"**.  

As a result, DNS queries for `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` failed, preventing the browser from retrieving the IP address and establishing an HTTPS connection to the server.

---

## Part 2 — Analysis and probable cause
The ICMP error message indicates that UDP packets reached a device that reported no service listening on UDP port 53.  
The most likely cause is that the **DNS service was not running or not bound to UDP/53** (for example, the DNS daemon was stopped or misconfigured).  

An alternative possibility is that a **firewall or network device** actively rejected DNS requests to port 53 and sent ICMP Port Unreachable responses.  

To confirm the root cause, server-side checks would be required:
- Verify DNS service status and configuration  
- Check listening ports (UDP/53)  
- Review firewall or access control rules  
- Run packet captures on the DNS server itself

## Lessons Learned
- ICMP “port unreachable” messages can originate from either a host with no service listening, or from a firewall actively rejecting packets.  
- Analyzing both DNS and ICMP traffic together provides valuable insight into why higher-level protocols (such as HTTPS) fail.  
- In incident reports, it is important to present both the **observed facts** (log evidence) and **possible causes** without over-speculation.

## Reflection

### What went well
- Correctly identified that DNS queries were failing on UDP/53 and that ICMP error messages were generated.
- Considered firewall blocking as a possible cause, showing awareness of common network security controls.
- Successfully followed the incident report template and separated observed facts from analysis.

### What could be improved
- Misinterpreted "port unreachable" as "the packet never arrived" instead of "the packet arrived but the port was not available or was actively rejected."
- Focused on a single cause (firewall) without considering other possibilities such as the DNS service being down or misconfigured.
- Did not clearly outline the next investigative steps (e.g., checking DNS service status, firewall rules, or listening ports).

### Lessons learned
- Always distinguish between **observed facts** (from logs) and **possible causes** (analysis).
- ICMP messages provide specific information that can narrow down the source of connectivity issues.
- An incident report is stronger when it includes not just the cause but also **next steps for investigation**.

### Next steps for myself
- Practice interpreting other ICMP messages (e.g., *network unreachable*, *host unreachable*, *time exceeded*).
- For future exercises, list at least two possible causes for any incident.
- Improve my ability to think in English by summarizing findings in simple English sentences, even if my understanding is basic at first.
